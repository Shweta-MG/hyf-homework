🏁 Getting Started
Environment variables
All sensitive data like fx passwords and usernames, we dont want to add to git! This problem we solve by having environment variables. Environment variables are not committed to git and have a key value structure.

Remember to copy the .env.example file, and rename the copied file to .env. In the .env file add the relevant host, database name, database user and pasword to your own local database. If you are unsure of these things then select your database in the Mysql Workbench. Now press Database -> Manage Connections.... Here you can see everything you need except the password. If you forgot that, reset it.

Prerequisites
Postman
MySQL Workbench
Installing
To install run npm install

🎈 Usage

The api can now be found on http://localhost:3000/api/ an example is http://localhost:3000/api/meals
